# Project 3 — Password Manager & Security Search

## Overview
This project is a console-based Password Manager that:
- Stores credentials in an encrypted vault file using XOR (0–255 key)
- Supports CRUD operations (Add / Retrieve / Update / Delete)
- Compares Linear Search vs Binary Search performance and generates a plot (`perf_plot.png`)

## Files
- `Project3_PasswordManager.py` — Main program
- `Project3_PasswordManager_Report.pdf` — Final report
- `perf_plot.png` — Performance plot (generated by the program)

> Note: Vault files like `vault_<username>.dat` and `.bak` are generated automatically during runtime and are not required for submission.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+ (tested on Python 3.12)
- (Optional for plotting) `matplotlib`
  - Install: `python -m pip install matplotlib`

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal in the project folder.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python Project3_PasswordManager.py
   ```
3. Enter:
   - Username (e.g., `mo`)
   - XOR numeric key (0–255)

## Menu Options (Main Features)
1. Add password  
2. Retrieve password (Linear Search)  
3. Retrieve password (Binary Search)  
4. Update password  
5. Delete password  
6. List sites  
7. Save (creates a `.bak` backup before overwrite)  
8. Run Performance Analysis (Part 3) — generates `perf_plot.png`  
9. Switch User  
0. Exit (NO auto-save)

## Performance Analysis (Part 3)
- The program benchmarks Linear vs Binary search for multiple vault sizes (N)
- Each search is repeated 200 times
- Output includes timing in milliseconds and saves the chart as:
  - `perf_plot.png`
